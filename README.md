### What is the BPM Toolkit ?  

BPM means "Business Process Management".

[BPM according to IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/automation-software/business-process-management). 

The goal was to provide a highly secured approval system that can be used in HR, supply chain management, finance in order to fix some shortcomings in the Power Platform like the 30 days approval limitation, no tasks delegation, no state machine, no graphical view of the running workflows,...

If you create custom actions, you will need the Per flow license (500$/month for the whole company)
If you want a RPA interaction, you will need the Per Flow license + 1 RPA license
